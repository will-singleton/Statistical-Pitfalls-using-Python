# Statistical-Pitfalls-using-Python
This is an interactive lesson on statistical analysis using python covering:

1) how to simulate different types of data
2) the importance of means, variance and sample size in data
3) type I/II error and statistical power
4) polynomial modelling
5) extrapolation
6) under and overfitting

Some frequentist statistics with some very basic python knowlege is assumed

This lesson must be opened using Jupyter Notebook - this can be accessed through Anaconda Navigator. 
All code is self contained - no addational data is needed.
